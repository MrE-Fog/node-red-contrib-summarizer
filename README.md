# node-red-contrib-summariser
A Node-RED node that generates summaries from arrays of data

An array of data is passed in the `msg.payload` in the form:
```
[
  {"field1": <data>},
  {"field2": <data>},
  {"field3": <data>},
  ...
]
```

In the node's configuration, you can define a set of rules that apply to a field within the data table.
Each rule delivers its result on a separate output.

Rules available:

**Sum**

The `Sum` rule sums the numerical values in the given field across the arrays. It returns a single number in `msg.payload`.

**Count**

The `Count` rule counts the number of times the field occurs in the arrays.  It returns a single number in `msg.payload`.

**Mean**

The `Mean` rule calculates the mean of the numerical values in the given field across the arrays. It returns a single number in `msg.payload`.

**Group**

The `Group` rule calculates the frequency that every value in the given field occurs in the array. It returns an object where the values are the key, and the frequencies a returned as the value for the given key. This can be passed directly into a `split` node where the keys are emitted in `msg.topic` ready for the node-red-dashboard chart nodes.
